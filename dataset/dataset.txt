White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at being bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy
I'm a bad
Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em "Fuck 12, fuck SWAT"
Bustin' all the bales out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in a box, mm
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo-deals, we been trappin' like the '80's
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know, where you at, at?
I was out back, where the stash at
Cruise the city in a bulletproof Cadillac (skrrt)
'Cause I know these niggas after where the bag at
Gotta move smarter, gotta move harder
Niggas tryna get me for my water
I lay his ass down on my son or my daughter
I had the Draco with me, Dwayne Carter
'Lotta niggas out here playin', ain't ballin'
I done put my whole arm in the rim, Vince Carter
And I know probably get a key for the quarter
Shawty barely seen in double C's I bought her
Got a bitch that's looking like Aaliyah, she a model
I got the pink slip, all my whips is key-less
Compton, I'm about to get the key to the city
Patek like the sea, forget it
Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em "Fuck 12, fuck SWAT"
Bustin' all the bales out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in a box, mm
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo-deals, we been trappin' like the '80's
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know, where you at, at?
Ha-ha-ha, I been movin' 'em out
If Steelo with me, then he got the blues in the pouch
Took her to the forest, put the wood in her mouth
Bitch don't wear no shoes in my house
The private I'm flyin' in, I never wanna fly again
I take my chances in traffic
She suckin' on dick no hands with it
I just made the Rollie plain like a landing-strip
I'm a 2020 president candidate
I done put a hunnid bands on Zimmerman shit
I been movin' real gangsta, so that's why she pick a Crip
Shawty call me Crisco, 'cause I pop my shit
Got it out the mud, there's nothin' you can tell me, yeah
When I had the drugs, I was street-wealthy, yeah
Pullin' out the coupe at the lot
Told 'em "Fuck 12, fuck SWAT"
Bustin' all the bales out the box
I just hit a lick with the box
Had to put the stick in a box, mm
Pour up the whole damn seal, I'ma get lazy
I got the mojo-deals, we been trappin' like the '80's
She sucked a nigga soul, gotta Cash App
Told 'em wipe a nigga nose, say slatt, slatt
I won't never sell my soul, and I can back that
And I really wanna know, where you at, at?
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I

Every day discovering something brand new

Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in, and you kicking me out
You've got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright

My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind


'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh oh

How many times do I have to tell you
Even when you're crying you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing, in my head for you

My head's under water
But I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind


'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh oh


Give me all of you
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard

'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you

I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh oh
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
Talk to me, I need to hear you need me like I need you
Fall for me, I wanna know you feel how I feel for you, love
Before you, baby, I was numb, drown the pain by pouring up
Speeding fast on the run, never want to get caught up
Now you the one that I'm calling
Swore that I'd never forget, don't think I'm just talking
I think I might go all in, no exceptions, girl, I need ya
Feeling like I'm out of my mind, 'cause I can't get enough
Only one that I give my time, 'cause I got time for ya
Might make an exception for ya, 'cause I been feeling ya
Think I might be out of my mind, I think that you're the one
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
My last made me feel like I would never try again
But when I saw you, I felt something I never felt
Come closer, I'll give you all my love
If you treat me right, baby, I'll give you everything
I'll never give my all again
'Cause I'm sick of falling down
When I open up and give my trust
They find a way to break it down
Tear me up inside, and you break me down
Yeah, I just had a lil' bit too much of Hennessy
Just gotta tell you how I feel
You so fuckin' precious when you smile
Hit it from the back and drive you wild
Girl, I lose myself up in those eyes
I just had to let you know you're mine
Hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, I can't look away, I just gotta say
I'm so fucking happy you're alive
Swear to God, I'm down if you're down all you gotta say is right
Girl anything I can do just to make you feel alright
Oh, I just had to let you know you're fine
Running circles 'round my mind
Even when it's rainy all you ever do is shine
You on fire, you a star just like Mariah
Man this feel incredible, I'll turn you into a bride, you're mine
Hands on your body, I don't wanna waste no time
Feels like forever even if forever's tonight
Just lay with me, waste this night away with me
You're mine, I can't look away, I just gotta say
I don't like my mind right now
Stacking up problems that are so unnecessary
Wish that I could slow things down
I wanna let go but there's comfort in the panic
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Yeah, I drive myself crazy
'Cause I can't escape the gravity
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
You say that I'm paranoid
But I'm pretty sure the world is out to get me
It's not like I make the choice
To let my mind stay so fucking messy
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I'm holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
I know I'm not the center of the universe
But you keep spinning 'round me just the same
And I drive myself crazy
Thinking everything's about me
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Holding on
So much more than I can carry
I keep dragging around what's bringing me down
If I just let go, I'd be set free
Holding on
Why is everything so heavy?
Why is everything so heavy?
Why is everything so heavy?

They can't fit me in a Trojan
Out of pocket, but I'm always in my bag
Yeah, that's the slogan
This that, "Who's all there?"
I'm pullin' up wit' a emo chick that's broken
This that college dropout music
Everyday leg day, she be too thick
And my friends are all annoying
But we go dumb, yeah, we go stupid
This that 10K on the table
Just so we can be secluded
And the vodka came diluted
One more line, I'm superhuman

Ya body, body, oh

I wanna put you in seven positions for seventy minutes
You'll get it babe
You got a lot on your mind
And I want to ease it up and lick it and slip it in
You do a light scream on the ice cream
When I scoop it and dip it in
Unzipping her tight jeans, and the feminine hygiene
Is magnificent
Tryna show you girl, I'm different
I get to licking and sticking and licking and sticking
Until the pussy get too wet and it's dripping and
Splitting both them legs like dividends
If it ends up how I want then
You'll end up sitting all over my bottom lip baby
The feeling of fucking you, feelings all up in you
Make it hard for you to bottle 'em baby
This dick is too big just to swallow it baby
But still you it like it's Thanksgiving
And you gobbin', gobblin', gobblin', gobblin', baby
Like what's a goon to a goblin baby?
That pussy hotter than the summer
June in metropolis baby, no hiding it baby

One, two, three, four
I think I'm losing my mind
Trying to stay inside the lines
It's like I'm running in place
How you keep staying the same?
Baby, I, I guess I'm something different
And I'm okay with that
I can't fake no more smiles
That shit gon' drive me mad
I'm focused on the future
Don't care 'bout nothin' else
Oh oh oh
I'm better by myself
I'm better by myself
I don't need no one else
I'm better by myself
Myself
Don't wanna answer questions
Just want your company
It's all good on the surface
Show me what's underneath
I'm not concerned with drama
I left that shit in school
I'm more concerned with commas
Than keeping up with you
Keep that away from me
I put the Heisman up to bad energy
No empathy, especially when the kid off Hennessy
Fake friends to me make my mood go south like Tennessee
Make the fool come out like, "Who is he?"
I mean, I tried to tell y'all
I'm better by myself
I'm better by myself
I don't need no one else
I'm better by myself
Myself
Self
I don't know who to trust
These days everyone's shady
Fool me once, I'm on my own
There is no second time, baby
That's the shit I don't like
Please no yes, no maybes
What else?
I'm better by myself
I'm better by myself
I don't need no one else
I'm better by myself
Myself
I tried to stop, but I can't stop
I just can't stop thinking about her
I don't know
All I remember was she wear the Skechers
The light-up ones

Wanna hold your hand, make you my girl
Light up, light up, Skechers

Yeah, if I could go back to the day we met

You run your mouth all over town
And this one goes out to the sound
Of breaking glass on my Range Rover
Pay me back or bitch, it's over
All the presents I would send
Fuck my friends behind my shoulder

Designer shoes and Xanax tabs

You never had to buy yourself a drink
'Cause everybody want to tap that ass sometime
And you got me thinking lately

You can turn me on with just a touch, baby

No one's around to judge me (oh)
I can't see clearly when you're gone

I'm reliving moments, peeling more residual
I can buy the building, burn the building, take your bitch
Rebuild the building just to fuck some more
I can justify my love for you
And touch the sky for God to stop debating war
Put the pussy on a pedestal
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for
That pussy to die for
Peter, piper, picked a pepper
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard, the diamonds yours
The coupe forever
My best shots might shoot forever like (brr)
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments, I'm way too numb
It's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, when you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time
Chal Bombay meri maa se milata hoon
Chal ghar pe tujhe haath se khilata hoon
Jo bhi bola woh haq se nibhata hoon
Tujhe chahta hoon! Tujhe chahta hoon!

Chal Bombay meri maa se milata hoon
Chal ghar pe tujhe haath se khilata hoon
Jo bhi bola woh haq se nibhata hoon
Tujhe chahta hoon! Tujhe chahta hoon!

Jab mere sath thi woh, meri khaas thi woh
Meri shootar, mera nasha, meri ghaas thi woh
Manali, Manali, kawwali, kawwali
Vo dikhati Madhuri jab pehne woh saree

Mere munh mein hai gali woh mithi zabaani
Vo gehara samandar main bahata hua pani
Main shayar mawwali, tera pichala woh jali
Ye asal na rani! Aha!

Zara ghoom kar dekh gaur se dekh
Tu hi thi koi aur nahin dekh
Har rasta hai apna main road se dekh
Pachtayegi pachtayegi tu chhod kar dekh

Ye gana nahin gana ye ashiq diwana
Kyon jale zamana to jalne de
Shayad samjhegi woh mere marne pe
Shayad samjhegi woh mere marne pe

Chal Bombay meri maa se milata hoon
Chal ghar pe tujhe haath se khilata hoon
Jo bhi bola woh haq se nibhata hoon
Tujhe chahta hoon! Tujhe chahta hoon!

Chal Bombay meri maa se milata hoon
Chal ghar pe tujhe haath se khilata hoon
Jo bhi bola woh haq se nibhata hoon
Tujhe chahta hoon! Tujhe chahta hoon!

Sun pagli haan maana meri galati
Teri saheli aur meri nahin jamati
Haan ye darkhwast hai, de raha nahin dhamaki
Jab se tu mili kasam meri kismat chamki

Haan mana mai sanaki pyar hai
Sirph tujhase aur dikhati nahin agali
Aur koi bhi nahin mangati
Haan de du har mala tu ban ja Vyjayanthi
Aur koi bhi aa jave hila doonga dharati
Bol tere papa, Mama ya Chacha ko

Goan ladka main desh bhar mein charcha hai
Safal ho jaye jo ek bar tu charch aaye
Public marti hai, ye tujhpe marta hai
Sach bolun to khali tujhse darta hai!

Chal Bombay meri maa se milata hoon
Chal ghar pe tujhe haath se khilata hoon
Jo bhi bola woh haq se nibhata hoon
Tujhe chahta hoon! Tujhe chahta hoon!

Chal Bombay meri maa se milata hoon
Chal ghar pe tujhe haath se khilata hoon
Jo bhi bola woh haq se nibhata hoon
Tujhe chahta hoon! Tujhe chahta hoon!

Feelin' like a pop star (21, 21, 21)
Drankin' Henny, bad bitches jumpin' in the pool

And you only got 6 cars?" (21)

House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me, I don't see a shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane
I switch up my cup, I kill any pain
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Look what you've done
I'm a motherfuckin' starboy
Every day a nigga try to test me, ah
Every day a nigga try to end me, ah
Pull off in that Roadster SV, ah
Pockets overweight, gettin' hefty, ah
Coming for the king, that's a far cry, ah
I come alive in the fall time, I
The competition, I don't really listen
I'm in the blue Mulsanne bumping New Edition
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony

Let a nigga Brad Pitt
Legend of the fall took the year like a bandit
Bought mama a crib and a brand new wagon
Now she hit the grocery shop looking lavish
Star Trek roof in that Wraith of Khan
Girls get loose when they hear this song
100 on the dash get me close to God
We don't pray for love, we just pray for cars
House so empty, need a centerpiece
Twenty racks a table cut from ebony
Cut that ivory into skinny pieces
Then she clean it with her face man I love my baby
You talking money, need a hearing aid
You talking 'bout me, I don't see a shade
Switch up my style, I take any lane

I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
I see the world through eyes covered in ink and bleach
Cross out the ones who heard my cries and watched me weep
I love everything
Fire spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush
Sh
Tape my eyes open to force reality
Why can't you just let me eat my weight in glee?
I live inside my own world of make-believe
Kids screaming in their cradles, profanities
Some days I feel skinnier than all the other days
And some days I can't tell if my body belongs to me
I love everything
Fire spreading all around my room
My world's so bright
It's hard to breathe but that's alright
Hush
sh
I wanna taste your content
Hold your breath and feel the tension
Devils hide behind redemption
Honesty is a one way gate to hell
I wanna taste consumption
Breathe faster to waste oxygen
Hear the children sing aloud
It's music till the wick burns out
Hush
Just wanna be care free lately, yeah
Just kicking up daisies
Got one too many quarters in my pockets
Count 'em like the four leaf clovers in my locket
Untied laces, yeah
Just tripping on daydreams
Got dirty little lullabies playing on repeat
Might as well just rot around the nursery and count sheep
